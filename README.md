# doctrine2-spatial



This is a fork of [creof/doctrine2-spatial](https://github.com/creof/doctrine2-spatial), a very good bundle to work with geographical extensions. 

I've found some limitations on the original bundle and I needed to do some small code changes, like explicitly setting the SRID in some functions like STGeomFromText.

I will be doing code changes only if I need it. Please, be careful when using this bundle. If [creof/doctrine2-spatial](https://github.com/creof/doctrine2-spatial) works for you, I would recomend to use it, instead of mine.
